## Install runtime dependencies

```
make install
```


## Install development dependencies

```
# This will also install the runtime dependencies
make dev_install
```

## Upgrade unpinned dependencies

```
make upgrade_dependencies
```

## Pre-commit hooks

We are using <https://pre-commit.com/> hooks, they are specified in the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and installed when you run `make dev_install`.
If the pre-commit configuration file is changed, remember to run `make dev_install` or `pre-commit install` again.

To manually force run the pre-commit tasks, you can type:

```bash
make pre-commit
```

## Make targets

The `Makefile` is a good resource to see how things are done.
Some of these targets include:

### Common checks before opening a PR

Includes the pre-commit hooks and running the tests with 
code coverage reports.

```bash
make check
```


### Extended checks to know more about the code

Includes security checks and other code smells.

```bash
make check-advanced
```

### Picky checks to be a code snob

Includes code complexity and documentation style checks.
```bash
make check-picky
```
